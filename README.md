## Documentation

Autogenerated docs via `Sphinx` can be found at <https://lmalina.github.io/pySC/>.

## Installing

Installation is currently suggested only for development purposes. 
We recommend creating a new virtual environment and installing from 
VCS in editable mode with all extra dependencies 
(`test` for `pytest` and relevant plugins, and `doc` for packages needed to build documentation)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmalina/pySC
pip install --editable "pySC[all]"
```
